## 1. Prologue

>The part that you’re not seeing is that I’m really bad about taking on too much stuff. I frequently have a hard time focusing on one thing at a time. I get really frustrated by that. I end up with tons of unfinished projects. That’s honestly something that I will probably be trying to figure out for the rest of my life. Being interested in everything all the time is great for being an artist, it’s a generative state of mind, but it’s also exhausting and can very easily cause me to just spin out.\
[Jenny Odell – On taking the time you need to notice, think, and grow](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/jenny-odell-on-taking-the-time-you-need-to-notice-think-and-grow/)

It's quite challenging to start writing about what sparked the interest to write on a certain topic. The above paragraph by Jenny Odell encapsulates perfectly how I feel. My interest in imagining and writing about decentralised libraries is mostly because I'm interested in everything. In a way I'm trying to cramp in every possible interest I have into a single one. Is that a possible feat? Well no, it's an utopia much like an universal public library. That doesn't stop me from trying though, or others to attempt to create a universal library.

In my adolescence I developed a passion for the internet, on my personal computer I would spend hours surfing, clicking links, spending time in chatroom and joining random forums. Internet searches followed internet searches, and one rabbit hole gave way to another. I'm getting at the fact that I'm a scrounger of information, I love digging for more bits and pieces. Finding something that leads to another and so on. Every piece of information gives way to another. A hyperlinked culture. 

This is also the reason that I started studies in graphic design, as I felt that this would enable me to be creative visually as well as theoretically. A designer can now be everything he wants to be, a curator, an author, a writer, a critic, a web dev, an artist, etc...

The freedom of being able to explore everything I could imagine, is one of the reasons that pushed me in that direction. Although at the start of my education, I only had a notion of digital visuals. Along the way I got to appreciate printed matter and develop a passion for the book as an object.

My reflexion arose while I was thrifting for books, I was wondering "Can you be a socialist and a collector?". These two conflicting words started my research.  "Are they really opposing views and mutually exclusive?". "Can a simple personal collection be shared with a wider audience?". The  premise of these questions started me on this political subject matter. 

I also started noticing a similarity between my book thrifting habits and my browsing binges. My passion for thrifting is the same as internet browsing, it's the thrill of the find. It's always a mixture of creating relations and following up on them as the accidental find. This is what serendipity is, a happy find, an unexpected discovery. This is partly how this paper came about, it's an accumulation of random happy discoveries and trying to link them together. To create an interlinked web of knowledge.


And so these discoveries are easily shared on the web, instantaneous messaging, message boards and social media platforms permits the sharing of a piece of information by the click of a button. 
Reproducing this behaviour with the collection of printed ephemera and books that I collected over the years didn't appear as easy. I get my joy out of the hunt for an item or piece of information and then sharing it with someone. I have no special interest in owning the items I have collected, I wish them to be shared and cared for though. Right now, my books are in the shelf on my library, unorganised in book piles on the floor and next to my bed. They are "rotting" there till I consult them, the only other person who has the opportunity to browse through them is my roommate. But I want others to have the opportunity to browse my small but ever growing collection of graphic design books, (maga)zines, typography books, art books, guidebooks and printed ephemera, almanacs... 

#### `

I firmly believe in the idea that information should be free[^1], information as in educational, cultural and scientific. Knowledge should be free. Open access is one of the important pillars of web activism, a belief that peer reviewed journals and scientific papers should be free for all. 

> "The Open Access Movement has fought 
valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure 
their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it."\
[Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto – Aaron Swartz. 2008.](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt)

Open access is a political stance against the privatisation of scientific knowledge. I wish to push it further, an open access to cultural materials. But I do not think that digital sharing and digitised books should be the only way to achieve this goal.

The book as an object has properties that can't be translated to the digital sphere as of yet. And although scanning gives access to the content of the book, it only does so in an incomplete manner. I'm a graphic designer at the core and a bibliophile second. The way I look at a book is in all its aspects. 
- The cover 
- The colophon
- The weight
- The smell
- The texture
- The transparency of the paper
- The shape of the book
- The paper 
- The typeface 
- The design and layout
- The printing method 
- The binding 
- The illustrations 
- And the subject matter. 

All what makes a book a book is interesting to me. A book is an artefact on its own, to me its as much an object that can be appraised for its beauty. As a tool for its content. Or another type of tool for reference in my graphic design work and typesetting. The book has a cultural value that gets lost when uploaded to the net.


#### `

I sometimes happen to share one of my books with my friends and peers as I know the content might interest them. But I wish there was an easier way of accessing the content of the community. An interlinked network of personal libraries. 
I want to see social interactions emerge out of the sharing of books. A hybrid model of a library that's a cross between the institutionalised public library and the functionings of the internet. 

Due to my small library collection, I consider myself a collector. The word collector has sadly a negatively connoted background, in the public imaginary you'll probably imagine a wealthy man with a vast collection of books. A dusty and old collection of books worth an exorbitant amount of money. It's a bourgeois occupation from a passed era when we think about it in that sense. A book collector to me is someone who has a personal library, a collection. The collection of books they have at home, the books they selected and bought for themselves. It can be a very modest affair. I want a participative decentralised library organised by the community, a learning garden for all. An alternative proposal to the utopian universal library.


> When everyone is librarian, library is everywhere.[^]

## 2. Introduction

((TO BE EXPANDED))`

((Write the introduction at last))


## 3. Evolution of libraries: a public and private affair


The emergence of libraries can be traced back to the earliest days of writing in Mesopotamia ((TO BE EXPANDED)) dating back to the midst of the fourth millennium B.C. My interest in tracing the evolution of the library is in seeing the interlacing of the public and the private in the creation of libraries. I also want to look into the library as a non-circulating collection, a physical collection that can be accessed in the reading room. The concept of a lending or circulating library is a recent one, having been introduced in the 19th century. In our collective imagination libraries have shifted to being lending libraries, although that's just a recent development. This will not be an extensive and exhaustive historical analysis of the evolution of the library but a brief overview to paint a picture. 

### 3.1. Early libraries

The first libraries would be more akin to modern record or archive centers than libraries. The Mesopotamians started their libraries as documentation centers to record the inventories and commercial transactions on small clay tablets. Writing evolved from pictograms to the cuneiform script to enable record keeping. On accounts of historians, these libraries and archives mark the end of the prehistory and the start of history. It is not known if those archives were "living archives" [^]. 

> Living archives refer to practices and environments that connect the organisation, curation and transmission of memory with present-bound creative, performative, and participatory processes. 

In simple terms living archives are archives that go beyond simple preservation and enable access and interaction with the materials. Although the archive as "living" isn't certain, they had well organised archives with archival relationships and considerations for long-term preservation.


### 3.2. Libraries in Antiquity

In the Ancient world libraries started to arise in bigger cities, it was a display of knowledge and power. A well-furnished library attracted scholars from around the region to come and study the texts. Beyond studying the texts they would go as far as write their own works there and copy existing works. 

Although multiple copies of works by popular authors could be found, many works were scarce. Not just texts were scarce but so were libraries, the library was the place were you consulted books. If the library did not contain the work you wanted you would have to travel the Mediterranean basin to find a library that kept a copy or the original. Since books were scarce and prised, libraries practiced a system of on-site consultancy. Books didn’t leave the premises and were cared for and protected.

#### `

##### 3.2.1 The Library of Alexandria

One of the most prominent libraries of Antiquity was the gigantic library of Alexandria. This ambitious library was built by the Ptolemaic dynasty, they intended to create the world's repository of knowledge. A library added to the city's prestige, incentivised scholars to study and thus provided assistance in the governing of the country. One could say that their ambitious role was met as they are remembered throughout history as the greatest library, it is noted that the library contained between 40'000 and 400'000 scrolls at its height. A project of this size was merely possible thanks to the royal funding of the Ptolemaic dynasty. 

#### `

To achieve their intent of being the universal knowledge hub, the Ptolemaic dynasty practised aggressive acquisition techniques and expensive book purchases. Every written work was of interest to the library, they would purchase works for astronomical amounts, pillage the libraries of vanquished cities and go as far as confiscate the scrolls from boats entering the port of Alexandria. Those confiscated scrolls were meticulously copied by hand, the library would keep the original and return the transcript to the waiting ship. Everything was welcome in the library, the more the better, the works were read, analysed and classified by the scholars. 

#### `

Although the library of Alexandria is considered a public library, it fails to be one considering modern interpretations. It wasn't accessible by all people of Alexandria, as a mere 10 percent of the population had decent enough literacy skills to do basic administrative work. To be able to read or enjoy the works collected in the library, one had to have a proficient reading level and the leisure to spend time at the library. Furthermore one had to have recommendation letters or be able to prove that they would tend to the library's collection. This privilege was thus reserved to a limited elite. In a way the library of Alexandria functions like a modern research institution.

#### `

##### 3.2.2. Roman libraries

In Roman times one had access to a variety of different libraries. First and foremost, private libraries maintained by wealthy individuals was still the norm. Big book collections were acquired as war booty and soon an active book market arose in late Republican Rome too. To be able to access a private library one had to be a friend or relative, or important enough to impress the library owner. Possessing a private library was a sign of prestige and wealth. The private libraries attracted scholarly cycles and politicians to come consult the collection and improved one's social status. 

#### `

Over time a shift happened from private libraries to public.Through deaths, battles and acquisitions many private book collections fell into Imperial hands.

#### `

Although imagined by Julius Caesar, the first public library in Rome came to fruition thanks to the collection of Asinius Pollio in 39 BC. A bit later, Emperor Augustus joined in and made his vast Imperial collection available to the public which gained him wide renown and political support. It is not sure who exactly had access to the public library but historians speculate on a wide socio-economic range seeing as to where the libraries where located in Ancient Rome. [^]

#### `
![Roman bath-house with libraries in B and L](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/12848579/original_767601ffcca00b7bc723aaf1fb78ccff.png?1629029949?bc=0)
Another Roman concept was the creation of public bath-houses with attached reading libraries. It is envisaged that bath-house libraries were used for entertainment purposes and more serious scholarly work happened at the various other public libraries. The bath-house libraries are also thought as having had a much wider audience as the bath-house complex was a popular activity intended for a large public. A public that comprised of people from a multitude of different ranks and social statute.
The Roman public library projects were made partly possible due to flourishing book collecting culture.

##### 3.2.3. Libraries in the middle ages


((TO BE EXPANDED))
The practice of a private library attached to a court or palace perdured in the Middle Ages but one saw the rise of monastic libraries.
In the Middle Ages, monasteries became the principal location to encounter books. The European monastic communities embraced the written word and produced many transcript of their books in the scriptoriums. Books were still very prised objects as many had been lost during the Antiquity, rules were put into place as well as curses to anyone who would steal the books made available. Sometimes books were lent out to other abbeys and on rare occasions to an individual if guaranty was provided. This is in some way an early form of a public library although the public was still limited to scholars having recommendation letters or nobles/merchants with assets.

#### `

In those times the monastery with its library was the proto-university, later on universities would start acquiring their own collections. Libraries started to bloom in the late middle ages due to the universities.


#### `

A notable feat marking the end of the middle ages is the invention of the printing press, this made book production more accessible to a larger public.

##  4. The library as a public space

A public library isn't merely a collection of books, it's a cultural hub with books at the center. 
The most obvious feature of a public library is the ability to have free access to a body of knowledge, ranging from books to multimedia content. The first social aspect to consider is the interactions with the librarians who are helping you navigate to through the maze of content and help you locate the books related to your interest. It's a community center with activities, reading clubs, presentations and workshops. The library can be seen as an open learning garden for everyone. A public library nowadays provides access to computers and wi-fi which have become necessities for job hunting, emails. 

It's a working space for students and people who need a quiet room or access to reading materials. A space where you can create your personal curriculum and learn independently at your own pace.

The library is one of the few "third places" in society. A "third place"[^] is a terminology coined by Ray Oldenburg to describe a place that fosters community life and social interactions in public, the first and second places are respectively home and the workplace. Generally "third places" are places where you feel at home, it's accessible socially and financially. A space, open for all, an area without discrimination where one can meet people, relax and feel welcomed.
It is a neutral ground for people to be in, a neutral ground outside of home or work. The library is one of the few public places left where people aren't expected to spend money.

> We also believe that cities are incubators of social, economic, environmental, political and cultural progress. They are equally the guardians of cultural heritage and identity which must be safeguarded to pass on to future generations. Subnational and local governments play an integral role in enhancing the diversity of urban life, through the adoption of rights-based approaches to cities and, in particular, with the promotion of gender equality and equal access to opportunities for all. They provide solutions for decent work, housing, and transport, the provision of basic cultural services such as libraries, tangible and living heritage, and community centres and adopt inclusive, accessible, and transparent participatory processes.

World Urban Forum, Abu Dhabi February 2020

In a recent report from the World Urban Forum libraries were declared as basic cultural necessities,**

### Artist-run Reading spaces

The library has also been reinvented with a multitude of artist-run reading spaces. One of such is Wendy’s Subway, it is "an accessible, creative space for everyone". The Wendy’s Subway space maintains a library with over 3000 books, the library collection is freely consultable on-site as it is a non-circulating library. 

> Wendy’s Subway is dedicated to encouraging creative, critical, and discursive engagement with arts and literature, with the belief that equitable access to reading and collaborative forms of knowledge-production are catalysts for social transformation.

### Temporary Library – Teaching Design

![Teaching Design – Temporary library](https://freight.cargo.site/w/2000/q/75/i/06b74a0f4757db76cb503abfa6bc1176ff8165ddc74fe7d0027b8d5371c73886/200201_AbisZ_001_bearb.jpg)

Temporary Library is an installation project by the Teaching Design research project. Initiated in 2019, Teaching Design is a collaborative critical design practice started by Lisa Baumgarten and Anja Neidhardt that focuses on intersectional feminism and decolonial perspectives. Through their practice they are collecting and sharing books to offer different perspectives on contemporary subjects.


> We created a space where people could come together, browse through the physical library, sit down for a tea, share experiences, stage public readings and offer workshops on design education. In this format, the focus was on conversations, building networks, collective reflection and providing a space for perspectives that are not heard enough.
> [https://teaching-design.net/participate](https://teaching-design.net/participate)


The Temporary Library was activated in the A-Z exhibition space that promotes graphic design projects that explores the unconventional and goes beyond the boundaries. The library served as tool to facilitate conversations around the topics of intersectional feminism and decolonisation. The aim being to change design education through conversational formats.

The books of the Temporary Library were provided by local libraries, bookshops and people willing to lend their book for the event. The idea being that the materials of the library are influenced by the people interacting with it. The network of people interacting with the library, change the basis of the library and the context of it. This shift due to participative engagement permits the library to be a different one every time, to propose a different selection and viewpoints.


**(((Teaching Design, the two-week long format CONVERSATIONS provides access to literature in a physical space as a framework to come together and connect with like-minded design educators – such as ourselves – and everybody interested in the field. Let’s share our experiences, doubts, questions, knowledge, concepts, methods and references to transform current structures!)))

The library located in the A-Z gallery radiates the aesthetics of a contemporary exhibition. A bay window facing the streets gives sight the the exhibition space, a long corridor splinter white walls emphasised by the bright yellow floors. A few shelves occupy the space with the centerpiece being a circled pink bench. The library is as much part of the exhibition as the exhibition while using contemporary museum codes. Workshops were also organised by the space while using the circled bench to facilitate exchange.

## 5. Collectors, Collecting & Collections? On a course of amateur librarianship.


> collector noun  
> someone who collects objects because they are beautiful, valuable, or interesting
> [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collector](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collector)

This definition above from the Cambridge dictionary is a succinct description that lacks in subtlety and background to explain the act(or) of collecting.
Collectors are foremost passionate people that get involved in the intricacies of their subject matter. 

Their collection is dear to them, and they assemble it with care. The items that make up a collection are relational, they have a vision on how they imagine their collection to be. They are the curators of their own museum. Along the way collectors become part of the books history, 
they are part of the provenance of the book. They can explain and justify its origins, this is mostly the case for rare books and not applicable to "common" ones. The collectors used to mark their books with an ex-libris (bookplate) to indicate the ownership of the books. Ex-libris, Latin for "from the books of", references also the provenance of the book. When a book would pass hand from one collector to the other, the new owner would mark the book with their own ex-libris. As such a record of ownership was kept on the front end-pages of the book.

Their knowledge of the books history is a privilege of the collector. The collector is as much a repository of knowledge as the books they possess. 
A collector is much like a hunter, constantly on the lookout and sniffing for information. But a collector is also someone who catalogs, displays, preserves, cleans and reads. The collector is a versatile character that has to play many roles. A whole process comes to life from the collection of a  book to the creation of a collection, a careful relational process. During this process of scouting an item and putting it into the library, collectors slowly become experts on the subject due to accumulating knowledge about their collection. A book collector thus comes close to being a librarian, the only distinguishing factor is that collectors don’t necessarily share their book knowledge and collection with a wider public. A librarians primary function is helping people find the content they are looking for in the vast sea of information. The job of a librarian is a social one, they have to understand the needs of the patron and guide them in the right direction. A good librarian might go as far as suggesting additional information you didn't think of. They are also experts in creating relational links between subjects. 

It would be valuable if collectors start identifying themselves as amateur librarians, sharing their wealth of knowledge and collections. It's grievous to think that many collectors forget to establish a procedure concerning their collection incase of their passing. A collector as amateur librarian would make them an active member of the community. An occasion for them to disseminate their acquired insights and make their collections known. Known as to provoke involvement and interest so the collection might one day live on.

#### `

A book collector can oftentimes possess a number of other printed ephemera, included or related to their books. To me as a graphic designer, these items are of particular interest. They are printed materials from a bygone era that aren't often preserved but still serve as exceptional reference items and inspiration. They are also part of graphic design history, I hope someday someone decides to preserve one of my random flyers. Examples of printed ephemera:
- invitation letters
- subscription letters
- stamps
- leaflets
- ex-libris
- cards
- pictures
- bookmarks
- stickers
- business card
- ...


Apart from the ephemera I'm also interested in older trivial and general book collections. The type of collection that isn't commonly found in a (special) library or elsewhere. The main reasons to not be found in the library are the fact that most of those type of books age badly and get "weeded" out or aren't actually considered as legitimate books to be added to the library. Those could include older:
- instruction manuals
- guidebooks
- magazines
- atlases
- almanachs
- comic books
- ...
These are all materials that are personally of high interest to me, mostly due to their rich visual language and their design. My attraction to these books comes from the fact that I look at them as a graphic designer first and a collector second. To me they are reference materials, tools that I can use or reference in a later work. My current method of finding these types of books is to stumble upon them by chance at a flea or second hand market.

#### `

One of the bigger differences between book collections and other type of collections is that books have a utility value, they are repositories of knowledge. Repositories of culture as well consisting of literary novels, poems and artist books.

#### `

Furthermore there exists a few kinds of collectors, they are not mutually exclusive. Collectors who collect because of the aesthetics, the subject matter or as a speculative investment. A collector in my opinion has each of these characteristics with varying levels.

Yet I want to distinguish two different types of collectors, the ones abundantly collecting the book as an object and the others as a tool. It's a crude but effective way of making the distinction between collectors aspiring to preserve and the others to "use"**. The ones contemplating the books as an important cultural artefact with economic value wouldn't be interested in a public library project. 
It's the latter one that's interesting to me, I'm speaking to them. I'm speaking to the collector that sees books as cultural tools with utility. The ones that have a love for books and would love to share about them.

>  Seneca the Younger deplored ostentatious book collecting, asking: "What is the use of possessing numberless books and libraries, whose titles their owner can hardly read through in a lifetime?"[^]

#### `

What's a collection of knowledge if it can't be shared with others?

#### `

What I understand as a collector in the following sections of this paper is broad. In my eyes anyone with a couple books will be considered as a collector. This collector is a bibliophile, one that doesn't need to have an extensive personal library to be considered a collector. 

##### "Public Library" project
In the paper "Amateur Librarian -A Course in Critical Pedagogy", Tomislav Medak and Marcell Mars outline a proposal for a curriculum. The curriculum of their library project "Public Library", the two simple words describe their project exactly. The project "Public Library" wants to be an universal library project, it's a radical proposal for a p2p library as a counteraction to the further privatisation of knowledge. A call for librarians, ["Why and How to Be(come) an Amateur Librarian"](https://www.memoryoftheworld.org/blog/2014/10/28/why_and_how_to_become_an_amateur_librarian/). They are of the arguing that if everyone is a librarian, the library is everywhere. In other words if everyone gives access to their library, we're creating a new community library that replaces our institutionalised public library. Everyone can be a librarian, and everyone is invited to be one. Their proposal for  "Public Library" is a system where amateur librarians share their personal libraries with the world through the open-source Calibre cataloging application using a script enabling peer to peer document sharing.

> Public library is:\
• free access to books for every member of society, \
• library catalogue,\
• librarian.\
\
With books ready to be shared, meticulously cataloged, everyone is a librarian. When everyone is librarian, library is everywhere.


"Public Library" is a political activist project that aims to disseminate universal knowledge to the world. Drawing from the history of the public library as an emancipation tool for the proletariat and the DIY know-how of technological advancements, "Public Library" shares all possible information they can get their hands on. Copyright be damned. It's an utopian dream of bringing about an universal library: ["universal access to knowledge for each member of our society."](https://www.memoryoftheworld.org/blog/2014/10/27/public_library_an_essay/)

> Freedom, equality, and brotherhood need brave librarians practicing civil disobedience.

Drawing from a historic genealogy of public library as the institution of access to knowledge, the proletarian tradition of really useful knowledge and the amateur agency driven by technological development, the curriculum covers a range of segments from immediately applicable workflows for scanning, sharing and using e- books, over politics and tactics around cus

The project Public Library was initiated with the counteraction in mind. To help everyone learn to use simple tools to be able to act as an Amateur Librarian – to digitize, to collect, to share, to preserve books and articles that were unaffordable, unavailable, undesirable in the troubled corners of the Earth we hail from.

## 6. Internet and mass access to information


> “Google can bring you back 100,000 answers,” as the writer Neil Gaiman once said. “A librarian can bring you back the right one.”


> Collaboration has also become key to the way we conceive associative indexing on today’s version of the Internet
> https://www.are.na/blog/towards-a-library-without-walls

Are.na platform community sourced collection and indexing


By digitising the book, you're erasing part of the books identity.

((fahrenheit it's a pleasure to burn))

Norbert wiener

curated information is good
((TO BE EXPANDED))

The internet has disrupted the monopoly of the library in being the primary source of access to information.

For many authors and even in the publics eye, the publishing of a printed document marks a symbolic moment in a writers career. It's considered a higher accomplishment than publishing an article on e-book online. The prestige of the printed volume is still present.

Another interesting factor is that book collectors aren't interested in a flat pdf file, they are interested in the book as object. Book collectors value the books for their printed form, 
All artbooks still come out as printed matter, because the book adds value to the subject matter.


## 7. Alternative library projects

I’ll also describe/analyse a few notable unconventional library project that motivated and spurred my research.

#### `
### Reanimation Library
The first one is the Reanimation Library, a free public library consisting of discarded books containing visual imagery. The project started 10 years ago by artist and librarian [Andrew Beccone](), he sees it as both an art project and a library. Their mission as a library is to contribute to the cultural commons and enable collaboration among people. The book collection is can only be viewed on site, their intention is to motivate people to use the books for creative work. The reading room is equipped with scanners and computers so library users can scan and copy the works they are interested in to be able to create new (art)works.

#### `

They want to point the visual richness of those sometimes seemingly ordinary books, the “outdated” visuals that can be used as building blocks for new content. These illustrations, drawings, etchings and schemas are incredible source material to create a multitude of new creative work. To them the library is a big learning garden where projects and ideas can bloom; they are quote that they want to “call attention to the generative potential of libraries”.

#### `

The Reanimation library sees themselves as a beacon in between the digital and the analog worlds, trying to bridge the gaps with books, scanners, computer and reading access. A remix potential of the ages.

#### `

In some way this project can be seen as an ecological and political critique of the consumerism in our society, old or “outdated” doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s obsolete. Older common books still have their merits even if not in the current views of the mainstream institutions. Relevant information is relative, it’s understandable that school books get replaced to teach students with the current matters but older textbooks are considerable resources to make comparative studies with the past.


### Surplus Library
The Surplus Library is a project initiated by artist Antonia Hirsch. Launched in 2011, the library is a non-circulating library that gets activated from time to time as physical collection at art fairs and museums. The Surplus' Library collection is a thematic one, encapsulating the concepts of "Affect & Economic Exchange". The artist assumes that these topics are linked and explores them with the thematic collection.

> In redefining the concept of a physical library, the Surplus Library on Affect & Economic Exchange operates on the basic assumption that its specific collection of books already exists in the material world: in the homes and private collections of potentially countless individuals. Some of the holdings of this vast and distributed library can become known and accessible through The Surplus Library site. The site develops as the library’s holdings and locations are registered by users.

The Surplus' Library site serves as portal into the accessible materials of the library, the website is covered with small thumbnails representing the book covers. On click, a separate page opens and further documentation is provided on the physical location of the book, if it's available and it's lender. Each book of the collection has been tagged by a set of keywords which enables further narrowing down of the topics to find relevant books.

** folksonomy, there is no controlled vocab


A small "More info" link brings up a limited amount of metadata of the book, the adding date to the collection and another final link "Contact branch".

Upon clicking that link, you're redirected to a page that asks you your email address to so a confirmation link can be sent, presumably to get into contact with the lender and arrange to consult the book. The act of participating in this distributed library plays further upon the title of the collection "On Affect & Economic Exchange". For one needs to get in touch with the other person for p2p-lending and trust them with the exchange of books.

The library doesn't shy away of referencing multiple copies of the same book. For example the book "Intangible Economies" is available at 3 different locations, two being in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and the last in Berlin, Germany. Referencing multiple nodes of the network permits to choose the location that most suits your needs. 

Laudable for its artistic merit, the few participants and the worldwide locations make it unpractical to access the physical books provided by the distributed library. The Berlin and Amsterdam nodes have multiple different libraries participating which makes it an effective local solution. On the other hand, the library also has a few lone libraries; one respectively in New York and the other in Toronto. "The site develops as the library’s holdings and locations are registered by users." The community makes or breaks the library, the library can only function if there is involvement. 

The Surplus Library is a hybrid model, mixing notions of web communication with physical books and community involvement.

> Instead, person-to-person borrowing and lending (owing and extending credit) in the physical world is facilitated by the site, thereby defying efficiency and convenience in its coupling of the material and the virtual. 

The efficiency of this type of system is limited, and although it would work with few people that know each other or of each other. A version of this library with a wider audience would be a nightmare of trust issues.

> “I still love books. Nothing a computer can do can compare to a book. You can't really put a book on the Internet. Three companies have offered to put books by me on the Net, and I said, 'If you can make something that has a nice jacket, nice paper with that nice smell, then we'll talk.' All the computer can give you is a manuscript. People don't want to read manuscripts. They want to read books. Books smell good. They look good. You can press it to your bosom. You can carry it in your pocket.”\

((( Some of Bradbury’s disdain for the Internet and digital publishing came from very real and understandable fears about his works being pirated and distributed through unofficial means, a concern that faces any content creator in the digital age. In a 2000 interview with the Peoria Journal Star, Bradbury said of the Internet, “Napster’s out there, stealing everyone blind. They’re stealing people’s work. They should be put in jail, all of them.” But his passion also sprang from his lifelong love of both libraries and books — physical books, not just the content contained within them. In that same interview, Bradbury said: ))))





I want to make the case of private interconnected physical libraries. A decentralised network of community knowledge.

We've arrived at a point where book scarcity is once again prevalent. My point of view on this matter is mostly related to art books although can be applied to any type of book. 

On the one hand there is a mass production of mainstream books being chugged out by big publishers, think American Hollywood blockbusters. On the other hand you have a multitude of small publishing house and thousands of DIY imprints. 

As a result of this, small imprints only receive limited distribution in each country or sometimes don't even leave the country of origin. The only place to encounter the book is at a niche bookstore before it gets sold out. After that the book solely lives on in the collectors library, public libraries have no interest or budget for niche publications.

Buying is ofcourse an option but the constant addition of new fascinating books makes this endeavour an unrealistic prospect.

Even public libraries and local bookstores aren't capable to acquire the vast proposal of various new books. Books that range from any type of subject to language to edition size. 

As I see it there’s a gap in the current library economy that can be bridged with an alternative model. The current models of libraries are public libraries, private ones and the digital ones (legal and pirate), each has its advantages and disadvantages. I want to propose an alternative hybrid model, a mix of the classic reference library with the concept of a hyperlinked culture.




### Curated

> Archives grow and develop over time. They are the creation, not of a single person, but of a long succession of clerks, secretaries, archivists and curators who have reshaped and reorganised them. As a curator myself, I’m intrigued by the ways that the physical organisation of archives can affect – and sometimes obstruct – their use by historians.
> ... by imposing ‘order’ on the archive we also impose meaning and interpretation. Until quite recently we used to organise correspondence according to a system that reflected (probably unconsciously) the British class structure: ‘Royal Correspondence’ (the royal family), ‘Special Correspondence’ (the great and the good), and ‘General Correspondence’ (everybody else). Nowadays we organise it by ‘fonds’ and ‘sub-fonds’, but in 100 years’ time I daresay this system will seem equally quaint and arbitrary and our successors will wonder why we adopted it.

This can be extrapolated to book collections.

This proposal for a new library model could be a welcome addition to fill this missing link. The missing link to have easier access to limited editions in your local area. Think of the library as the interconnected collections of collectors. A version where private collections make out individual nodes in a bigger local library for public use. We are at a time where the production of books is so extensive that no single person or even institution is able to gather each published work. That might have been the case in the Renaissance where wealthy patrons could have an extensive body of works that encompassed most of the current published literature, luckily that time has passed. Books are now abundant, from zines to coffee table books to literature to scientific journals; you can find tremendous amounts of printed matter in almost any subject or language you can think of. However this still doesn’t mean that all that material is easily accessible or available in your library or even bookshop. Due to the invention of the off-set printing press in the early 20th century the cost of printing books have drastically been reduced, nevertheless books aren’t always cheap or produced in high numbers. Limited edition and/or highly expensive books are difficult to find, your local or national library probably doesn’t have a copy. A lot of smaller edition foreign books often don’t find many copies traveling overseas and definitely do not see a copy in a local public library. Furthermore libraries have specific acquisition criteria put in place for the acquisition of new books, a multitude of small editions, niche content or underground editions will never be acquired by them. Niche editions are an important part of culture as they contain specialised knowledge on subjects ranging from work, technical research, hobbies, literature and as well as the voices of minority communities that aren’t always well represented within the institutional system.

#### `

An alternative to the current institutions would be a community-oriented library maintained and sourced from content originating from the collectors of the community. This local community library would have a catalog that represents its community as well as having content that wouldn’t easily be found elsewhere.

#### `

On multiple occasions I have had the annoyance of not finding a single copy of the book I was interested in. Sometimes I would find one, but it wouldn’t be easy to get a hold of; in a different city in a special collection where I needed to have a membership and ask for access. I once drowsily decided to order a copy from overseas, it was late at night but I noticed that there were no extra charges involved beyond the shipping. Imagine my surprise when 2 weeks later I had to pay a hefty tax to get the book delivered at home, the tax exceeded the price paid for the book. I complained to the seller and shipping company but never got a good explanation back, in that time the book got on the road again and got lost in a German UPS depot. Anyways speciality books or just older books are difficult to find. Older books sometimes even more so as libraries practice a “weeding” out process, books that aren’t consulted enough get discarded over time to make place for others as well as books that are considered deprecated since the knowledge on the subject matter has evolved over time. There’s a great example of the 

#### `

One of the benefits of interconnecting private libraries for public use is the ability to create a wide body of accessible materials. New collections could be created out of the aforementioned private libraries using any possible type of associations, a hyperlinked library shying away from the old library culture. It is up to the community to decide on collection creation, there’s no restrictions as in an institutionalised public library. Using a mix of controlled vocabulary and a folksonomy for the classification system will also allow users to be more in touch with the library and the creation of collections, they will use the terms they feel most ‘comfortable’ with.

#### `

(describe folksonomy)

#### `

Another important point of interconnected private libraries is the decentralised aspect of storage. It’s not ‘decentralised’ in a technological way but in the way that the collection is distributed amongst the several collectors. A library that uses the community as storage enables to have almost no discarding of materials, users provide their material to the library when needed. If the works aren’t displayed in the library, the works return to their respective owners. This system potentially enables the library to grow infinitely content wise. Following on this, an important aspect of having a distributed local library allows for a real inclusive view of the interest of the community, it’s a representation of their collection. But also what collections they want to create, show, or research using the materials at hand from the various private libraries.

#### `

As Mackenzie Wark writes in A Hacker Manifesto (2004), “The gift is marginal, but nevertheless plays a vital role in cementing reciprocal and communal relations among people who otherwise can only confront each other as buyers and sellers of commodities.” 

#### `

A decentralised system would permit the inclusion of a multitude of books that wouldn't be found in a traditional system.

#### `

Benefits of a decentralised library would include:
- increased storage
- access to out of print materials
- access to rare/limited edition
- increase social interaction
- learning garden
- access to multi-cultural content
- access to minority views on certain subjects
