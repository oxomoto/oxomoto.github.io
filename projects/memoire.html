<h2>0. Prologue</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The part that you’re not seeing is that I’m really bad about taking on too much stuff. I frequently have a hard time focusing on one thing at a time. I get really frustrated by that. I end up with tons of unfinished projects. That’s honestly something that I will probably be trying to figure out for the rest of my life. Being interested in everything all the time is great for being an artist, it’s a generative state of mind, but it’s also exhausting and can very easily cause me to just spin out.<br/>
<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/jenny-odell-on-taking-the-time-you-need-to-notice-think-and-grow/">Jenny Odell – On taking the time you need to notice, think, and grow</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's quite challenging to start writing about what sparked the interest to write on a certain topic. The above paragraph by Jenny Odell encapsulates perfectly how I feel. My interest in imagining and writing about decentralised libraries is mostly because I'm interested in everything. In a way I'm trying to cramp in every possible interest I have into a single one. Is that a possible feat? Well no, it's an utopia much like an universal public library. That doesn't stop me from trying though, or others to attempt to create a universal library.
In my adolescence I developed a passion for the internet and on my personal computer I would spend hours surfing, clicking links, spending time in chatrooms and joining random forums. Internet searches followed internet searches and one rabbit hole gave way to another. I'm getting at the fact that I'm a scrounger of information, I love digging for more bits and pieces. Finding something that leads to another and so on. Every piece of information gives way to another. A hyperlinked culture.</p>

<p>This is also the reason that I started studies in graphic design, as I felt that this would enable me to be creative visually as well as theoretically. A designer can now be everything he wants to be: a curator, an author, a writer, a critic, a web developer, an artist, etc...</p>

<p>The freedom of being able to explore everything I could imagine is one of the reasons that pushed me in that direction. Although at the start of my education I only had a notion of digital visuals, I gradually got to appreciate printed matter and develop a passion for the book as an object.</p>

<p>The start of my reflection for this paper arose while I was thrifting for books on the flea market, I was wondering &quot;Can you be a socialist and a collector?&quot;. These two conflicting words started my research. &quot;Are they really opposing views and mutually exclusive?&quot;. &quot;Can a simple personal collection be shared with a wider audience?&quot;. The premise of these questions started me on this political subject matter.</p>

<p>I also started noticing a similarity between my book thrifting habits and my browsing binges. My passion for thrifting is the same as internet browsing: it's the thrill of the find. It's always a mixture of creating relations and following up on them as the accidental find. This is what serendipity is, a happy find, an unexpected discovery. This is partly how this paper came about, it's an accumulation of random happy discoveries and trying to link them together. To create an interlinked web of knowledge.</p>

<p>And so all these discoveries are easily shared on the web, through instantaneous messaging, message boards and social media. All platforms that permit sharing a piece of information by the click of a button. Reproducing this behaviour with the collection of printed ephemera and books that I collected over the years didn't appear as easy. I get my joy out of the thrill and hunt for a book or piece of information. This joy is multiplied when I can share my finding with someone else. I have no special interest in owning the items I have collected. Instead, I wish them to be shared and cared for though. Right now, my books are on the shelves of my library, some unorganised in book piles on the floor and others next to my bed. They are &quot;rotting&quot; there till I consult them, I'm their sole reader. The only other person who has the opportunity to browse through them is my roommate. But I want others to have the same opportunity to browse my small but ever-growing collection of graphic design books, (maga)zines, typography books, art books, guidebooks and printed ephemera, almanacs...</p>

<p>I firmly believe in the idea that information should be free<sup><a href="#fn1-21922" id="fnr1-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, information as in educational, cultural and scientific. Knowledge should be free. Open access is one of the important pillars of web activism, a belief that peer reviewed journals and scientific papers should be free for all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Open Access Movement has fought
valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure
their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it.&quot;<br/>
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt">Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto – Aaron Swartz. 2008.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open access is a political stance against the privatisation of scientific knowledge. I wish to push it further, an open access to cultural materials. But I do not think that digital sharing and digitised books should be the only way to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>All what makes a book a book is interesting to me. A book is an artefact on its own, an artefact with artistic merit, one that can be appreciated for its beauty and its content. Appreciated for the artistry in its conception. Books started out as recipients for written information, a tool for its content but it has gotten so much more. I see the book as another type of tool, for me many books are reference books. Reference as in research and inspiration for my creative work. I'm inspired by the odd telephone book, the 1970's Ford car manual or a small Hachette paperback. The layouts and compositions of (older) books bring me perspective and different ideas. As I'm an aspiring type designer, the characters of these books are way better analysed in a physical copy than online. I'm able to see them how I want or to decide to scan it up to enormous resolutions. These are all ways in which my books help me progress into the field of graphic design.</p>

<p>I sometimes happen to share books of my collection with friends and peers as I know the content are of interest to them. But oftentimes I help my friends more by linking to content and pdfs I have collected on are.na or sending the url of the article I remembered reading. But I wish there was an easier way of sharing the content of a personal library. A way in which the community could access your personal library and vice-versa. An interlinked network of personal libraries. I want to see social interactions emerge out of the sharing of books. A hybrid model of a library that's a cross between the institutionalised public library and the functionings of the internet.</p>

<p>Due to my small library collection, I consider myself a collector, a word which unfortunately carries a negatively connoted background. In the public imaginary you'll probably imagine a wealthy man with a vast collection of books. A dusty and old collection of books worth an exorbitant amount of money. A bourgeois occupation from a passed era when we think about it in that sense. A book collector to me is someone who has a personal library, a collection. The collection of books they have at home, the books they selected and bought for themselves. It can be a very modest affair. A personal library. I want a participative decentralised library organised by the community, a learning garden for all. An alternative proposal for an utopian universal library. A physical and social proposal.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The notion of a library is a millennia old concept that has perdured through the ages and which has seen substantial development alongside society's progression. While at its core, libraries have always served as a hub of information collection and dissemination, the accessibility to this information as well as the method of organising libraries has evolved drastically over the years. With the emergence and rapid progress of digital technologies, we have been brought about to redefine our perception about information gathering and sharing. This new concept of digital data has become a standard that is slowly leaving the analog format of data behind.</p>

<p>Against the background of this evolution, my main purpose in this thesis is to propose an alternative to existing structures. One that is grounded in making information free and accessible for the benefit of society. One that still holds the analog format dear while embracing progressive approaches to organising data. </p>

<p>In order to come to my proposal, I will start off describing the first forms of western society starting from the earliest days of writing in Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>The second chapter will delve into several approaches of modern takes on libraries. These contemporary libraries take on different formats and visions.</p>

<p>As a third chapter I'll touch on the subject of collectors who have been essential for the creation of libraries. </p>

<p>In my final chapter I'll discuss my proposal of a physical decentralised library which is community-led, reflecting on my findings in the preceding chapters.</p>

<p>This protocol is further explored in the appendix to this thesis named <em>Shell Library Protocol</em> and which delves deeper into the functionings of my proposal.</p>

<h2>2. Evolution of libraries: a public and private affair</h2>

<p>The emergence of libraries can be traced back to the earliest days of writing in Mesopotamia <em>circa</em> the middle of the fourth millennium B.C.<sup><a href="#fn3-21922" id="fnr3-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> My interest in tracing the evolution of the library is in seeing the interlacing of the public and the private in the creation of libraries. I also want to look into the library as a non-circulating collection, a physical collection that can be accessed in the reading room. The concept of a lending or circulating library is a recent one, having been introduced in the 19th century. In our collective imagination libraries have shifted to being lending libraries, although that's just a recent development. This will not be an extensive and exhaustive historical analysis of the evolution of the library but a brief overview to paint a picture.</p>

<h3>2.1 Early libraries</h3>

<p>The first libraries would be more akin to modern record or archive centers than libraries<sup><a href="#fn4-21922" id="fnr4-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. The Mesopotamians started their libraries as documentation centers to record the inventories and commercial transactions on small clay tablets. Writing evolved from pictograms to the cuneiform script to enable record keeping. The records contained many documents ranging from religious, economic, political and scholarly ones.On accounts of historians, these libraries and archives mark the end of the prehistory and the start of history. It is not known if those archives were &quot;living archives&quot;<sup><a href="#fn5-21922" id="fnr5-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Living archives refer to practices and environments that connect the organisation, curation and transmission of memory with present-bound creative, performative, and participatory processes.<br/>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cura.12384">Sabiescu, A.G. (2020), Living Archives and The Social Transmission of Memory.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple terms living archives are archives that go beyond simple preservation and enable access and interaction with the materials. Although the archive as &quot;living&quot; isn't certain, the Meopotamian society had well organised archives with archival relationships and considerations for long-term preservation.</p>

<h3>2.2 Libraries in Antiquity</h3>

<p>In the ancient world libraries started to arise in bigger cities, where they served as a display of knowledge and power. A well-furnished library attracted scholars from around the region to come and study the texts. Beyond studying the texts they would write their own works there and copy existing works.</p>

<p>Although multiple copies of works by popular authors could be found, many works were scarce. Not just texts were scarce but so were libraries, the library was THE place where you consulted books. If the library did not contain the work you wanted you would have to travel the Mediterranean basin to find a library that kept a copy or the original. Since books were scarce and prized, libraries practiced a system of on-site consultancy. Books didn’t leave the premises and were cared for and protected.</p>

<h5>The Library of Alexandria</h5>

<p>One of the most prominent libraries of Antiquity was the gigantic library of Alexandria<sup><a href="#fn6-21922" id="fnr6-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. This ambitious library was built by the Ptolemaic dynasty, who intended to create the world's repository of knowledge. A library added to the city's prestige and incentivised scholars to study and thus provided assistance in the governing of the country. One could say that their ambitious role was met as they are remembered throughout history as the greatest library; it is noted that the library contained between 40'000 and 400'000 scrolls at its height. A project of this size was merely possible thanks to the royal funding of the Ptolemaic dynasty.</p>

<p>To achieve their intent of being the universal knowledge hub, the Ptolemaic dynasty practised aggressive acquisition techniques and expensive book purchases. Every written work was of interest to the library, they would purchase works for astronomical amounts, pillage the libraries of vanquished cities and go as far as confiscate the scrolls from boats entering the port of Alexandria. Those confiscated scrolls were meticulously copied by hand, the library would keep the original and return the transcript to the waiting ship. Everything was welcome in the library, the more the better, as they tried to become the universal world library. The works were read, analysed and classified by the scholars.</p>

<p>Although the library of Alexandria is considered a public library, it fails to be one considering modern interpretations. It wasn't accessible by all people of Alexandria, as a mere 10 percent of the population had decent enough literacy skills to do basic administrative work. To be able to read or enjoy the works collected in the library, one had to have a proficient reading level and the leisure to spend time at the library. </p>

<p>Furthermore, one had to have recommendation letters or be able to prove that they would tend to the library's collection. This privilege was thus reserved to a limited elite. In a way the library of Alexandria functions like a modern research institution.
In these times books were made out of papyrus reeds.<sup><a href="#fn7-21922" id="fnr7-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup> A papyrus book came in the form of a scroll made out of several sheets of papyrus and had a length of 10 meters or more. Invented around 3000 B.C. papyrus was the defacto writing material and got shipped to the rest of Europe.<sup><a href="#fn8-21922" id="fnr8-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<h5>Roman libraries</h5>

<p>In Roman times one had access to a variety of different libraries. First and foremost, private libraries maintained by wealthy individuals was still the norm. Big book collections were acquired as war booty and soon an active book market arose in late Republican Rome too. To be able to access a private library one had to be a friend or relative, or important enough to impress the library owner. Possessing a private library was a sign of prestige and wealth. The private libraries attracted scholarly cycles and politicians to come consult the collection and improved one's social status.</p>

<p>Over time a shift happened from private libraries to public. Through deaths, battles and acquisitions many private book collections fell into Imperial hands.</p>

<p>Although imagined by Julius Caesar, the first public library in Rome came to fruition thanks to the collection of Asinius Pollio in 39 BC. A bit later, Emperor Augustus joined in and made his vast Imperial collection available to the public which gained him wide renown and political support. It is not sure who exactly had access to the public library but historians speculate on a wide socio-economic range seeing as to where the libraries were located in Ancient Rome. <sup><a href="#fn9-21922" id="fnr9-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<figcaption>Roman bath-house with libraries in B and L</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another Roman concept was the creation of public bathhouses with attached reading libraries. It is envisaged that bathhouse libraries were used for entertainment purposes and more serious scholarly work happened at the various other public libraries. The bathhouse libraries are also thought as having had a much wider audience as a visit to the bathhouse complex was a popular activity intended for a large public. A public that comprised of people from a multitude of different ranks and social statute.<sup><a href="#fn9-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> The Roman public library projects were thus made partly possible due to a flourishing book collecting culture.</p>

<p>Papyrus scrolls were still heavily in use but the end of the first century BC saw the arrival of parchment usage. Parchment is a writing material made out of treated animal skin typically sheep, calf or goatskin. The advantages were extra flexibility compared to papyrus and the possibility to write on both sides of the parchment. Towards the third century AD parchment became the preferred writing material.<sup><a href="#fn10-21922" id="fnr10-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<h5>2.3 Libraries in the middle ages</h5>

<p>The practice of a private library attached to a court or palace perdured in the Middle Ages but one saw the rise of monastic libraries.<sup><a href="#fn11-21922" id="fnr11-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> In the Middle Ages, monasteries became the principal location to encounter books. The European monastic communities embraced the written word and produced many transcript of their books in the scriptoriums. Books were still very prised objects as many had been lost during the Antiquity, rules were put into place as well as curses to anyone who would steal the books made available. Sometimes books were lent out to other abbeys and on rare occasions to an individual if a guarantee was provided. This is in some way an early form of a public library although the public was still limited to scholars having recommendation letters or nobles/merchants with assets.</p>

<p>In those times the monastery with its library was the proto-university, later on universities would start acquiring their own collections. Libraries started to bloom in the late Middle Ages due to the universities.</p>

<p>Books adapted another format in the Middle Ages that we are still accustomed to to this day. In the second century AD , the scroll got rapidly displaced by the use of a codex with parchment. Historians believe the codex was popularised by the Christians through bibles as scrolls were seen as pagan. A codex is much like the modern book a stack of pages bound by the edges. The advantages of this invention were considerable as it permitted books to be in a single volume and more compact. Apart from typical parchment, one also saw the use of vellum, which was a higher quality and more refined version made out of calfskin.<sup><a href="#fn12-21922" id="fnr12-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<figure>
<img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/12869852/original_0ac2f9483aec8fa562125b4c93fad241.png?1629200987?bc=0" alt="Printer in 1568 13" />
<figcaption>Printer in 1568 <sup><a href="#fn13-21922" id="fnr13-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A notable feat marking the end of the Middle Ages is the invention of the movable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in around 1448. This made book production much quicker and cost effective and thus more accessible to a larger public. It was a big factor in the dissemination of Renaissance ideas.<sup><a href="#fn14-21922" id="fnr14-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<h5>2.4 Subscription libraries and beyond</h5>

<p>At the start of the 19th century public libraries weren’t easily found. The model that was adopted was the subscription library, patrons gained access to private library clubs by way of subscription. Subscription libraries were generally specialised and required high entry fees. Subscription libraries had a democratic policy in place as it would acquire books that would benefit the members. The members chose the collection and the librarians managing it.<sup><a href="#fn15-21922" id="fnr15-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></sup>
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-35831853
In the middle of the 19th century the notion of public libraries began to be raised and realised. There was an interest in indulging the “curiosity” of poor students and workers associations wanted to educate their members more. This is also coupled with the Industrialisation of Europe that gave birth to the printed press.<sup><a href="#fn16-21922" id="fnr16-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<h2>3. Library Models Now</h2>

<p>In this chapter I’d like to explore the library models that are existing now. From the traditional public library that hasn’t changed much since the introduction of lending libraries in the 19th century, to alternative projects, art installations and digital libraries. There’s no denying that the advent of the internet has changed our perception of the library and the possibilities they entail.</p>

<h5>3.1 The public library model now</h5>

<p>As seen from the history of the library, the latest model of the lending library is still in effect. Although the library in recent years has seen some additions. First of all, the library is now also seen as an important cultural center that provides a space for everyone. It has become a social hub where apart from reading and studying, group activities such as reading clubs, book presentations and workshops are organised. The public library has also evolved to meet the technological advancements and offers various multimedia content like audio materials, e-books and DVDs. A public library nowadays provides free access to a number of other services like computers and wi-fi which have become necessities for job hunting, emails and basic research.</p>

<p>An interesting development that can be traced back to monastic libraries is the use of Inter Library Lending (ILL). The public library network allows for a book to be reserved at another library and be sent to the user’s public library. This procedure of ILL can include some administrative and shipping fees as it can be used nationally and internationally. It is also important to note that not all content of public libraries qualify for Inter Library Lending as such the Koninklijke Belgische Bibliotheek (KBR)<sup><a href="#fn17-21922" id="fnr17-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a></sup> has a list of exceptions. This list is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>documents from the Legal Deposit</li>
<li>precious works</li>
<li>documents from the Prints Department and the Chalcography Department</li>
<li>documents dating from before 1850</li>
<li>documents in poor condition</li>
<li>large sizes (folios)</li>
<li>reference works</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some public libraries have started to adapt due to the use of digital platforms to propose a model called &quot;Controlled Digital Lending&quot;. Controlled Digital Lending<sup><a href="#fn18-21922" id="fnr18-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a></sup> (CDL) is a library practice where digitised books from the library are lent out in the same way a physical book would be. This model recreates the scarcity model of the physical public library, if a user checks out a book then the book isn't available anymore. Since the books are from the physical collection of the Public library, once a digital copy has been lent out, the physical book will stay unavailable for the lending period and so will the digital copy. A digital rights management (DRM) software will lock or delete the digital copy after the end of the lending period. This scarcity model is recreated with CDL so that it can be lent to a user at a time and pass copyright regulations.</p>

<h5>3.2 Reanimation Library</h5>

<p>A more artistic library proposition is the Reanimation Library, a free public library consisting of discarded books containing visual imagery. The project started 10 years ago by artist and librarian Andrew Beccone<sup><a href="#fn19-21922" id="fnr19-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a></sup>, he sees it as both an art project and a library. Their mission as a library is to contribute to the cultural commons and enable collaboration among people. The book collection can only be viewed on site and their intention is to motivate people to use the books for creative work. The reading room is equipped with scanners and computers so library users can scan and copy the works they are interested in to be able to create new (art)works.</p>

<p>They want to point out the visual richness of those sometimes seemingly ordinary books, the “outdated” visuals that can be used as building blocks for new content. These illustrations, drawings, etchings and schemas are incredible source material to create a multitude of new creative work. To them the library is a big learning garden where projects and ideas can bloom; they are quote that they want to “call attention to the generative potential of libraries”.</p>

<p>The Reanimation library sees themselves as a beacon in between the digital and the analog worlds, trying to bridge the gaps with books, scanners, computer and reading access. A remix potential of the ages.</p>

<p>In some way this project can be seen as an ecological and political critique of the consumerism in our society, old or “outdated” doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s obsolete. Older common books still have their merits even if not in the current views of the mainstream institutions. Relevant information is relative, it’s understandable that schoolbooks get replaced to teach students with the current matters but older textbooks are considerable resources to make comparative studies with the past.</p>

<h5>3.3 Surplus Library</h5>

<p>The Surplus Library<sup><a href="#fn20-21922" id="fnr20-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a></sup> is a project initiated by artist Antonia Hirsch. Launched in 2011, the library is a non-circulating library that gets activated from time to time as physical collection at art fairs and museums. The Surplus' Library collection is a thematic one, encapsulating the concepts of &quot;Affect &amp; Economic Exchange&quot;. The artist assumes that these topics are linked and explores them with the thematic collection.</p>

<p>In redefining the concept of a physical library, the Surplus Library on Affect &amp; Economic Exchange operates on the basic assumption that its specific collection of books already exists in the material world: in the homes and private collections of potentially countless individuals. Some of the holdings of this vast and distributed library can become known and accessible through The Surplus Library site. The site develops as the library’s holdings and locations are registered by users.
The Surplus' Library site serves as portal into the accessible materials of the library, the website is covered with small thumbnails representing the book covers. On click, a separate page opens and further documentation is provided on the physical location of the book, if it's available and it's lender. Each book of the collection has been tagged by a set of keywords which enables further narrowing down of the topics to find relevant books.</p>

<p>A small &quot;More info&quot; link brings up a limited amount of metadata of the book, the adding date to the collection and another final link &quot;Contact branch&quot;.</p>

<p>Upon clicking that link, you're redirected to a page that asks you your email address to so a confirmation link can be sent, presumably to get into contact with the lender and arrange to consult the book. The act of participating in this distributed library plays further upon the title of the collection &quot;On Affect &amp; Economic Exchange&quot;. For one needs to get in touch with the other person for p2p-lending and trust them with the exchange of books.</p>

<p>The library doesn't shy away of referencing multiple copies of the same book. For example the book &quot;Intangible Economies&quot; is available at 3 different locations, two being in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and the last in Berlin, Germany. Referencing multiple nodes of the network permits to choose the location that most suits your needs.</p>

<p>Laudable for its artistic merit, the few participants and the worldwide locations make it impractical to access the physical books provided by the distributed library. The Berlin and Amsterdam nodes have multiple different libraries participating which makes it an effective local solution. On the other hand, the library also has a few lone libraries; one respectively in New York and the other in Toronto. &quot;The site develops as the library’s holdings and locations are registered by users.&quot; The community makes or breaks the library, the library can only function if there is involvement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Surplus Library is a hybrid model, mixing notions of web communication with physical books and community involvement.
Instead, person-to-person borrowing and lending (owing and extending credit) in the physical world is facilitated by the site, thereby defying efficiency and convenience in its coupling of the material and the virtual.

<a href="https://thesurpluslibrary.com/about">https://thesurpluslibrary.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The efficiency of this type of system is limited, and although it would work with few people that know each other or of each other. A version of this library with a wider audience would be a nightmare of trust issues. </p>

<h5>3.4 Bibliothèque à bords perdus</h5>

<p>The <em>&quot;Bibliothèque à bords perdus&quot;</em><sup><a href="#fn21-21922" id="fnr21-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a></sup> is a project carried out by CIVA (an architectural museum and archive center) at the KANAL museum in Brussels in anticipation of the new library, it aims to question the future role of the library and to initiate a reflection on the library as a public space and how these findings can nourish the future creation of the permanent library at KANAL. They advance that the library in these uncertain times cannot be considered as a &quot;temple of knowledge&quot; that gives all the answers. They as well see it as a &quot;third space&quot;, a living space built around books but where exchange and activities are primordial. To propose a true pluralism of choice, the library is made up of books selected by the public. Individuals from different professions help constitute the collection of the library, the general public is also invited to contributed. The contribution takes place thanks to a system of donating, exchanging and adding, this process together with classification makes the library an ever growing and changing organism. How can the library adapt to the changing perception of information processing induced by the usage of internet? Fragmented reading, hyperlink culture and an overflow of content are new ways of processing information. How can the library fit in to this? <sup><a href="#fn22-21922" id="fnr22-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a></sup></p>

<h5>3.5 Wendy’s Subway Space</h5>

<p>The library has also been reinvented with a multitude of artist-run reading spaces. One of such is Wendy’s Subway, it is &quot;an accessible, creative space for everyone&quot;. They are a non-profit reading room as well as writing space and an independent publisher. Wendy’s Subway is located in Brooklyn and maintains a free library with over 3000 books, the library collection is consultable on-site as it is a non-circulating library.
Wendy’s Subway is dedicated to encouraging creative, critical, and discursive engagement with arts and literature, with the belief that equitable access to reading and collaborative forms of knowledge-production are catalysts for social transformation.
The space works as a public library but offers much more than that. They are focused on reading and writing in its many different forms and encouraging access to those materials so it might bring on social change. They believe in the “collaborative forms of knowledge-production”<sup><a href="#fn23-21922" id="fnr23-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">23</a></sup> to achieve that transformation. &quot;Featured shelf&quot; is a part of their website, that shows off a curated collection of books to read selected by their members. </p>

<h5>3.6 &quot;Public Library&quot; project</h5>

<p>In the paper &quot;Amateur Librarian -A Course in Critical Pedagogy&quot;<sup><a href="#fn24-21922" id="fnr24-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">24</a></sup>, Tomislav Medak and Marcell Mars outline a proposal for a curriculum. The curriculum of their library project &quot;Public Library&quot;, the two simple words describe their project exactly. The project &quot;Public Library&quot; wants to be a universal library project, it's a radical proposal for a p2p library as a counteraction to the further privatisation of knowledge. A call for librarians, &quot;Why and How to Be(come) an Amateur Librarian&quot;. They argue that if everyone is a librarian, the library is everywhere. In other words, if everyone gives access to their library, we're creating a new community library that replaces our institutionalised public library. Everyone can be a librarian, and everyone is invited to be one. Their proposal for &quot;Public Library&quot; is a system where amateur librarians share their personal libraries with the world through the open-source Calibre cataloging application using a script enabling peer to peer document sharing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public library is:
free access to books for every member of society,
library catalogue,
librarian.</p>

<p>With books ready to be shared, meticulously cataloged, everyone is a librarian. When everyone is librarian, library is everywhere.
Excerpt from &quot;Public Library&quot; proposal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Public Library&quot; is a political activist project that aims to disseminate universal knowledge to the world. Drawing from the history of the public library as an emancipation tool for the proletariat and the DIY know-how of technological advancements, &quot;Public Library&quot; shares all possible information they can get their hands on. Copyright be damned. It's an utopian dream of bringing about an universal library: &quot;universal access to knowledge for each member of our society.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freedom, equality, and brotherhood need brave librarians practicing civil disobedience.
Other excerpt from &quot;Public Library&quot; proposal</p>
</blockquote>

<h5>3.7 Temporary Library – Teaching Design</h5>

<p>Temporary Library is an installation project by the Teaching Design research project. Initiated in 2019, Teaching Design is a collaborative critical design practice started by Lisa Baumgarten and Anja Neidhardt<sup><a href="#fn25-21922" id="fnr25-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">25</a></sup> that focuses on intersectional feminism and decolonial perspectives. Through their practice they are collecting and sharing books to offer different perspectives on contemporary subjects.
We created a space where people could come together, browse through the physical library, sit down for a tea, share experiences, stage public readings and offer workshops on design education.</p>

<p><img src="https://freight.cargo.site/w/1000/i/06b74a0f4757db76cb503abfa6bc1176ff8165ddc74fe7d0027b8d5371c73886/200201_AbisZ_001_bearb.jpg" alt="Teaching Design – Temporary library" /></p>

<p>The Temporary Library was activated in the A-Z exhibition space that promotes graphic design projects that explores the unconventional and goes beyond the boundaries. The library served as a tool to facilitate conversations around the topics of intersectional feminism and decolonisation. The aim being to change design education through conversational formats.</p>

<p>The books of the Temporary Library were provided by local libraries, bookshops and people willing to lend their book for the event. The idea being that the materials of the library are influenced by the people interacting with it. The network of people interacting with the library, change the basis of the library and the context of it. This shift due to participative engagement permits the library to be a different one every time, to propose a different selection and viewpoints. The focus in this library is put on conversation, creating links, think together and give a room for minority voices.</p>

<p>The library located in the A-Z gallery radiates the aesthetics of a contemporary exhibition. A bay window facing the streets gives sight to the exhibition space, a long corridor splinter white walls emphasised by the bright yellow floors. A few shelves occupy the space with the centerpiece being a circled pink bench. The library is the exhibition. Workshops were also organised by the space while using the circled bench to facilitate exchange.</p>

<h5>3.8 Shadow Libraries</h5>

<p>Shadow libraries are other important actors in providing book access on the internet. Anchored in open access principles, shadow libraries are slightly hidden websites proposing digitised books, e-books and papers to download freely. These websites have multiple mirror-sites as they get taken down due to copyright infringement.<sup><a href="#fn26-21922" id="fnr26-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Notable sites include Library Genesis, Sci-hub, Z-library and aaaaarg.
An interesting 2020 study from Cornell University<sup><a href="#fn27-21922" id="fnr27-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">27</a></sup> noted that articles downloaded from Sci-hub were cited 1.72 times more than the ones who weren't downloaded, which suggests that downloaded papers are heavily used for research and other papers.</p>

<h5>3.9 Are.na</h5>

<p>A last type of digital library that I would like to touch upon are community archive and research platforms like are.na. “What might ‘librarianship’ mean for a platform like Are.na?”<sup><a href="#fn28-21922" id="fnr28-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">28</a></sup> This question posted on are.na prompted Karly Wildenhaus to write an informative blog post titled &quot;Towards A Library Without Walls&quot;<sup><a href="#fn29-21922" id="fnr29-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">29</a></sup>. In this post she exposes that library systems often have rigid and hierarchical structures put in place and that she as an arts librarian is interested in a more playful approach that would consider different discovery tools. She notes tools that can help with &quot;abstraction, visual resources, and serendipitous browsing.&quot; This is where I completely align with her, classical searching has never been my strong suit and didn't give me any pleasure. Serendipitous browsing brings up the occasional informational gem. The informational gem, I wasn't searching for but one that makes me shift my whole perspective of things. And this is where associative thinking comes to play, hyper-linking texts and concepts that weren't put together to bring to something new. As Wildenhaus puts it are.na is such a platform that allows this &quot;A hypertextual platform like Are.na then can show us what modes of knowledge production and sharing elude the tools already in place in libraries, offering alternative strategies for organizing and sharing information.&quot;</p>

<p>Are.na is research tool that looks like a bare-bones Pinterest but offers much more. Users themselves have a hard time defining what are.na is and how to best use it. Founder Charles Broskoski himself started a collaborative channel titled &quot;How do you describe Are.na at a party?<sup><a href="#fn30-21922" id="fnr30-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">30</a></sup>, answers range from memes to twitter like phrases and poetic descriptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pinterest like organization, with tumblr like content that is more academic and resourceful. but it’s kinda what you make it</p>

<p>folders on desktop turned into social media</p>

<p>“Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se.”</p>

<p>The easiest way to find a Rem Koolhaas pdf that's not behind a paywall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short are.na enables users to create channels, much like Pinterest boards, and attach blocks to them. These blocks can be textual, websites, pdf or images. Users can link other content to their channels or collaborative channels, and connections are shown. The connections between block and channel but also channel and channel are indexed on the site. Are.na proposes a form of hyper-linked culture with associative thinking and pattern recognition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“[D]ocuments do not merely carry information, they help make it, structure it, and validate it. More intriguing, perhaps, documents also help structure society, enabling social groups to form, develop, and maintain a sense of shared identity. Viewing documents as mere information carriers overlooks this social role.”
Paul Duguid and John Seely Brown</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote by Paul Duguid and John Seely Brown articulates Karly's Wildenhaus ideas on crowdsourcing content and associative indexing. I'm also of the idea that dynamic collection through participative indexing and associative thinking leads to the creation of richer communities. The social aspect of sharing and organising, is an important factor to non-traditional knowledge creation.</p>

<h5>3.10 The internet</h5>

<p>The advent of the internet has disrupted the importance of the library in being the primary source of access to written information. But as writer Neil Gaiman once said “Google can bring you back 100,000 answers. A librarian can bring you back the right one.”<sup><a href="#fn31-21922" id="fnr31-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">31</a></sup> In a few clicks one can have 100's of pages of Google search results to sift through. With the internet the concept of curation got lost, although it's coming back with subject specific sites and blogs creating reading lists. A librarian's job is to help you navigate the rows of books and find the one you were looking for. This with the internet disappeared, now content is fighting for the top result in google searches. The &quot;curated&quot; content is now due to an algorithm, interspersed with people trying to master SEO to push their content to the top results and just straight up paying for ads so it comes first.</p>

<h2>5. Collectors, Collecting &amp; Collections</h2>

<p>As seen from the evolution of the libraries, collectors have always had an important role to play in the creation of their collections. In these following lines I’d like to define the collector and analyse their motivations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>collector noun</p>

<p>someone who collects objects because they are beautiful, valuable, or interesting </p>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collector">Cambridge Dictionary</a><sup><a href="#fn32-21922" id="fnr32-21922" title="see footnote" class="footnote">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This above definition from the Cambridge dictionary is a succinct description that lacks in subtlety and background to explain the act(or) of collecting. Collectors are foremost passionate people that get involved in the intricacies of their subject matter.</p>

<p>In an essay written by Firsts magazine, the premier magazine for book collectors, one can read the following on the two type of book collectors: “The first, and much the largest, is made up of those who see books as consumables. The second, less common, includes those who see books as beautiful objects.”</p>

<p>They go on how the collection isn’t merely for the aesthetic appreciation of the book but also “take pleasure from the intellectual content of their books, but they also enjoy the process of assembling their collections.” Because to them the collection is an extension of their interests. Their collection is dear to them, and they assemble it with care. The hunt and search towards materials for the collection is also a principal part of the enjoyment.</p>

<p>The items that make up a collection are relational, the collector has a vision on how they imagine their collection to be. They are the curators of their own personal museum. Along the way collectors become part of the book’s history, they become part of the provenance of the book. They have been passed the torch about the books origin and can pass it on, this is often the case for &quot;rare&quot; books and less applicable to &quot;common&quot; ones. The collectors used to mark their books with an ex-libris (a bookplate) to indicate the ownership of the books. An ex-libris is a printed or illustrated label marking the collectors ownership, often pasted onto the endpaper of a book. Ex-libris, Latin for &quot;from the books of&quot;, references also the provenance of the book. When a book would pass hand from one collector to the other, the new owner would mark the book with their own ex-libris. As such a record of ownership was kept on the front end-pages of the book.</p>

<p>There is also no denying that many collectors do it for an economic reason, supply and demand dictates that first editions will become rarer. “Many first edition books appreciate in value over time. The laws of supply and demand dictate that.”
Their knowledge of the book’s history is a privilege of the collector. The collector is as much a repository of knowledge as the books they possess. This is due to the fact that a collector is much like a hunter, constantly on the lookout and sniffing for information. But a collector is also someone who catalogues, displays, preserves, cleans and reads. The collector is a versatile character that has to play many roles. A whole process comes to life from the collection of a book to the creation of a collection, a careful relational process. During this process of scouting an item and putting it into the library, collectors slowly become knowledgeable on the subject due to accumulating bits of information about their collection. </p>

<p>The writer Nassim Taleb describes the relation of a collector, namely Umberto Eco, to his books in his novel Black Swan. In this passage, two visitor types are identified when walking into Umberto Eco's personal 30,000 book library. The first ones go “Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have. How many of these books have you read?” and the others he says, a small minority, will get the point of a library as a research tool. &quot;The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means … allow you to put there.&quot; Unread books aren't like Taleb says &quot;ego-boosting appendages&quot;, no they are an accumulation of books you wish to read or find interesting. Socrates back in the day already put it so well “The more I know, the more I realise I know nothing.”, with each bit of information we realise that we haven't digged deep enough. Collectors set themselves up for a vast exporation, they are constructing their personal collection based on their interests. Interests which grow because of new information and can't be satiated. This collection of unread books is conceptualised by Taleb as the &quot;anti-library&quot;.^ Although unread, a collector knows why this specific work is enclosed within their collection since its their curated library. They have built a knowledge of relational links between books.
One book leads to another and the collector is primed to lead you through their collection by taking you through the hoops. A book collector thus comes close to being a librarian, the only distinguishing factor is that collectors don’t necessarily share their book knowledge and collection with a wider public. A librarians primary function is helping people find the content they are looking for in the vast sea of information. The job of a librarian is a social one, they have to understand the needs of the patron and guide them in the right direction. A zealous librarian might go as far as suggesting additional information you didn't think of. They are also experts in creating relational links between subjects.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting change of pace if collectors start identifying themselves as amateur librarians, sharing their wealth of knowledge and collections. It's personally grievous to think that many book collectors forget to establish a procedure concerning their collection in case of their passing. I have heard from first-hand experience that many a book collection gets thrown in the bin since no one was willing to adopt the collection. Others might set up a foundation, like Wittockiana ^,Michel Wittock's collection of exceptional book bindings. The creation of a foundation, museum or donating to a like-minded individual preserves the curated selection. It enables a personal library to have perennity and live on. In the case of a foundation or other type of institution it gives access to the collection to a wider audience. Imagining a collector as amateur librarian would make for a welcome alternative. It would position them as active members of the community. An activity where they could share their physical personal collection and provide additional oral information. An occasion for them to disseminate their acquired insights and make their collections known. Known as to provoke involvement and interest so the collection might one day live on.</p>

<p>A book collector can oftentimes possess a number of book related content that wouldn't be found in public libraries. These would be ephemera, written or printed materials that aren't supposed to be preserved. To me as a graphic designer, these items are of particular interest. These outdated materials are a rich visual source of inspiration. I'm often attracted to the type of these materials as they serve as exceptional reference materials, and just a beauty to behold. They are also part of graphic design history, I hope someday someone decides to preserve one of my random flyers. Examples of printed ephemera:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>invitation letters</li>
<li>subscription letters</li>
<li>stamps</li>
<li>leaflets</li>
<li>ex-libris</li>
<li>catalogues</li>
<li>exhibition flyers</li>
<li>greeting cards</li>
<li>museum cartels</li>
<li>bookmarks</li>
<li>stickers</li>
<li>business cards</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the ephemera I'm also interested in older trivial and general books. These types of books aren't commonly found anymore, unless in a special library. The main reasons to not be found in the library are the fact that most of those types of books age badly and get &quot;weeded&quot; out. &quot;Weeding&quot; is a library process where books are evaluated following criteria to determine if they still have a place in the library. Such criteria are for example book usage, book relevance and factuality. Other books that may be difficult to find in a public library are books that aren't considered &quot;legitimate&quot; enough to be added. Those could include (older):</p>

<ul>
<li>instruction manuals</li>
<li>guidebooks</li>
<li>magazines</li>
<li>atlases</li>
<li>almanachs</li>
<li>comic books</li>
<li>zines</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all materials that are personally of high interest to me, mostly due to their rich visual language and their design. My attraction to these books comes from the fact that I look at them as a graphic designer first and a collector second. To me they are reference materials, tools that I can use or reference in a later work. My current method of finding these types of books is to stumble upon them by chance at a flea or secondhand market.</p>

<p>One of the bigger differences between book collections and other type of collections is that books have a utility value, they are repositories of knowledge. Repositories of culture as well consisting of literary novels, poems and artist books.
The distinction made by Firsts magazines is quite radical, collectors collect books as consumables and other ones for their beauty. Throughout this chapter, I have touched upon the different characteristics of a collector, and they are not mutually exclusive. Collectors collect because of the aesthetics, the subject matter or as a speculative investment. A collector in my opinion has each of these characteristics with varying levels.</p>

<p>Yet I want to distinguish two different types of collectors, the ones abundantly collecting the book as an valuable objects and the others as a multi-versed utility tool. The first ones regards books as important cultural artefacts with economic value, and thus an investment. I doubt that they would be interested in participating in a public library project, unless they can be offered a guarantee for protection of their books. It's the other type of collector that I envision for this participative model, namely the collector that sees books as cultural tools with societal utility. The ones that have a love for books and would love to share about them.
Seneca the Younger deplored ostentatious book collecting, asking: &quot;What is the use of possessing numberless books and libraries, whose titles their owner can hardly read through in a lifetime?&quot;^</p>

<p>What's a collection of knowledge if it can't be shared with others? What I understand as a collector in the following sections of this paper is broad. In my eyes anyone with a personal library, extensive or not is considered a collector.</p>

<h2>5. Towards physical decentralised libraries and amateur librarians</h2>

<p>This final chapter will expose my ideas in creating a new hybrid model of a library. I feel like there is an opening for an alternative library that would fill some lackings of the current models. I want to make the case of private interconnected physical libraries. A decentralised network of community knowledge. Anchored in the belief of Open Access, I wish to push it further and adapt this mostly digital concept to the physical space.</p>

<p>My proposal is as follows, the creation of a participative public library constituted of personal libraries. A community led library that is open to the public with collections created by the community. The social and educational aspects lie in the community created library collections, through associative thinking and group participation knowledge production comes to stand. The libraries' references would be indexed in an online database to permit search functions and help in collection creation. This concept is fleshed out in &quot;Shell Library Protocol&quot;, my protocol for this participative decentralised physical and local library. This protocol is in appendix to this paper.</p>

<p>A public library isn't merely a collection of books, as seen in the previous library models, a library is a cultural hub with books. Those books are sometimes at the center, yet not always as the book sometimes serves as medium towards other activities and share with one another. A library is also like the reading rooms of old a space where you can create your own personal curriculum and learn independently at your own pace.
The social aspects of the library makes it one of the few &quot;third places&quot; in society. A &quot;third place&quot;^ is a terminology coined by Ray Oldenburg to describe a place that fosters community life and social interactions in public, the first and second places being respectively home and the workplace. Generally, &quot;third places&quot; are places where you feel at home, it's accessible socially and financially. A space, open for all, an area without discrimination where one can meet people, relax and feel welcomed. It is a neutral ground for people to be in, a neutral ground outside of home or work. On top of that the library is also one of the few public places left where people aren't expected to spend money. The World Urban Forum in Abu Dhabi noted that they provide “basic cultural services such as libraries”.</p>

<p>We've arrived at a point where book scarcity is once again prevalent. My point of view on this matter is mostly related to art books although can be applied to any type of book.
On the one hand there is a mass production of mainstream books being chugged out by big publishers, think Penguin Books or Gallimard in France. The top five publishers of the year 2018 in France accounted for over a 1000 books each that year. On the other hand, you have a multitude of small publishing house and thousands of DIY imprints with small print runs ranging from 50 to 2000, such as the Dutch publisher Onomatopee.
As a result of this, small imprints have a limited reach due to the limited stock in each country and sometimes in case of zines don't even leave the country of origin. The only place to encounter the book is at a niche bookstore before it gets sold out. After that the book solely lives on in the collector’s library.</p>

<p>With the volumes of books around public libraries and local bookstores aren't capable to acquire the vast proposal of various new books, this is due to budget but mostly due to storage. A public library might have smaller imprints of national books but forget about foreign ones. A public library sadly isn’t The universal library yet and doesn’t contain all foreign books, small imprints, DIY zines or older books. I’m mostly interested in art, design and theory books, a vast number of these are written in English and sadly these books are very hard to come by in a country like Belgium. Buying the books directly from the publisher is a possibility but depending on your socio-economic background, it isn’t a viable solution.
We are in a time where the production of books is so extensive that no single person or even institution is able to gather each published work (maybe in digital format if they can locate it). That might have been the case in the Renaissance where wealthy patrons could have an extensive library that encompassed most of the current published literature, but luckily that time has passed. Books are now abundant, from zines to coffee table books to literature to scientific journals; you can find tremendous amounts of printed matter in almost any subject or language you can think of. </p>

<p>However, this still doesn’t mean that all that material is easily accessible or available in your library or even bookshop. Due to the invention of the off-set printing press in the early 20th century the cost of printing books has drastically been reduced. In the 1950’s this paved the way for the paperback revolution and books that used to be hardcover weren’t considered “upscale commodity” anymore. Nevertheless, books aren’t always cheap or produced in high numbers. Limited edition and/or highly expensive books are difficult to find, where your local or national library probably doesn’t have a copy of. A lot of smaller edition foreign books often don’t find many copies traveling overseas and definitely do not see a copy in a local public library. Furthermore, libraries have specific acquisition criteria put in place for the acquisition of new books, a multitude of small editions, niche content or underground editions will never be acquired by them. Niche editions are an important part of culture as they contain specialised knowledge on subjects ranging from work, technical research, hobbies, literature and as well as the voices of minority communities that aren’t always well represented within the institutional system.</p>

<p>As I see it there’s a gap in the current library economy that can be bridged with an alternative model. The current models of libraries are public libraries, private ones and the digital ones (legal and pirate), each has its advantages and disadvantages. I want to propose an alternative hybrid model, a mix of the classic reference library with the concept of a hyperlinked culture.</p>

<p>This proposal for a new library model could be a welcome addition to fill this missing link. The missing link to have easier access to limited editions in your local area. A proposal where the local community pools together their personal libraries to create an interconnected network. Think of the library as a decentralised model made up of a vast array of individual collector nodes. A version where interconnected personal libraries become the universal public library. This local community library would have a catalogue that represents its community as well as having content that wouldn’t easily be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of interconnecting personal libraries for public use is the ability to create a wide body of accessible materials. But the more interesting part is the social aspect that it enables. A library isn’t going to get build by itself, a library needs librarians. As Marcell Mars proposed in his “On a cours of amateur-librarianship”: “if everyone is a librarian, the library is everywhere”. Let us as collectors and individuals with personal libraries become amateur-librarians to create collections for the public local library. </p>

<p>New collections would be created out of the personal libraries using any possible type of associations, tagging systems or classification. A community-led library isn’t restricted by the rigid structures of an institutionalised library. A hyperlinked library shying away from the old library culture.</p>

<p>Herein lies the potential of a participative local and decentralised library. In the social aspect of collection creation, moments where through associative thinking new collections emerge and thus community knowledge-production takes place. It is an educational and cultural proposal led by the community themselves, an experiment in empirical knowledge production and information sharing.
 Using a mix of controlled vocabulary and a folksonomy for the classification system will also allow users to be more in touch with the library and the creation of collections, they will use the terms they feel most ‘comfortable’ with.</p>

<p>Another important point of interconnected private libraries is the decentralised aspect of storage. It’s not ‘decentralised’ in a technological way but in the way that the collection is distributed amongst the several collectors. A library that uses the community as storage enables to have almost no discarding of materials, users provide their material to the library when needed. If the works aren’t displayed in the library, the works return to their respective owners. This system potentially enables the library to grow infinitely content wise. Following on this, an important aspect of having a distributed local library allows for a real inclusive view of the interest of the community, it’s a representation of their collection. But also what collections they want to create, show, or research using the materials at hand from the various private libraries.</p>

<p>As Mackenzie Wark writes in A Hacker Manifesto (2004), “The gift is marginal, but nevertheless plays a vital role in cementing reciprocal and communal relations among people who otherwise can only confront each other as buyers and sellers of commodities.”</p>

<p>A decentralised system would permit the inclusion of a multitude of books that wouldn't be found in a traditional system.</p>

<p>Benefits of a decentralised library would include:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>increased storage
access to out-of-print materials
access to rare/limited editions
increased local social interaction
associative thinking
community knowledge-production through collection creation
being a learning garden
access to multi-cultural content
access to minority views on certain subjects</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>As touched upon in this research, the notion of the library is essentially an evolutive concept. A concept that is constantly redefined against society's state and our need to access information.</p>

<p>My library proposal aims to address certain shortcomings of current library models, with a focus on a societal engagement. Without disregarding the possibilities offered by contemporary technologies, this proposal revolves around the core concept of the physical book, in the belief of an open access to all.</p>
